What is Modbus?

•	Modbus is a serial communication protocol developed by Modicon published by Modicon® in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). 
•	In simple terms, it is a method used for transmitting information over serial lines between electronic devices. 
•	The device requesting the information is called the Modbus Master and the devices supplying information are Modbus Slaves. 
•	In a standard Modbus network, there is one Master and up to 247 Slaves, each with a unique Slave Address from 1 to 247. 
•	The Master can also write information to the Slaves.
•	The official Modbus specification can be found at www.modbus.org/specs.php
